Broadband Internet and end to end Data service  Mode of Connection to the Broadband Network: In order to deliver both data and internet services to customer, the customer must first be connected to the ALAPCOM/AccessTEL Broadband Access Network. The physical connectivity of the customer to the ALAPCOM/AccessTEL Access Network is achieved via multiple Broadband technologies available to the group as follows: •	Fiber Optics Technology •	Pre-WiMax Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) Wireless Access Technology on Exclusive 3.5 GHz Band •	Point to Point Line-of-Sight (LOS), Near Line-of-Site Wireless Technology on 2.4 GHz & 5.8 GHz Non Exclusive Band  The above-mentioned mode of connectivity is determined based on the client service requirement and geographic location to ensure the most cost effective and efficient Broadband Access.  Once the customer is connected to the AccessTEL Broadband Network, the following Broadband services can be accessed:  •	Dedicated Internet Bandwidth (as required by the customer) for the Corporate office network •	Dedicated Intranet (Data) Bandwidth for establishing a private Wide Area Network for data transmission requirement between the customers multiple office locations. Multiple modes are used to establish the private network as follows:  VPN: Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) transmit digital information over shared infrastructures with the same secure and reliable connectivity as private networks but at a lower cost. Moving information over VPN is also simpler and more cost-effective than using traditional dedicated-line networks. Types of VPN:  - IP VPN (CPE Based Layer 3 Customer Network) - MPLS VPN (Carrier Based Layer 2 & 3 Network)  IP VPN: Most CPE-based VPNs operate over the public Internet, using broadband or dedicated access lines and tunneling protocols to secure the data. The underlying IP network simply provides transport for VPN traffic. IP VPNs are privatized networks implemented over either the public Internet backbone or a service provider’s private IP backbone, making use of shared IP facilities to build an enterprise’s private WAN. IP offers any-to-any connectivity. In addition, private IP VPNs offer the security and predictable performance of private networks while adhering to the protocol standards of the Internet.  MPLS VPN: In carrier network-hosted VPN services, the network is directly involved in the functioning of the VPN. MPLS VPN is an effective technology capable of providing secure Layer 3 or Layer 2 VPNs over the carrier operated network.  It is a replacement for expensive dedicated circuits.  Layer 3 MPLS VPN WAN service allows subscribers to migrate away from the traditional “hub-and-spoke” design, enhancing scalability.  MPLS VPNs enable the service provider to keep customers' private business traffic logically separated through the use of virtual circuit-like connections known as label switched paths (LSPs). MPLS VPNs provide the same level of security as Layer 2 VPNs, equivalent to that of private circuits. MPLS VPNs offer address space and routing separation, and they are resistant to attacks and label spoofing. In an MPLS environment, a VPN customer may perform IP-source address spoofing, but because there is a strict separation between VPNs and between the VPN and the core, this type of spoofing remains within the VPN where it originated.  Cloud based e-mail Service To adopt with the updated technology and to offer ultimate e-mail solution to the industry, AccessTEL launched Cloud based e-mail service with Google. To offer this sophisticated service to the clients, AccessTEL become regional partner with Google and delivering G-Suite cloud based e-mail service to corporate clients.

Customer communication network disruption can be minimized where the customer office communication network equipment is provided and supported by AccessTEL.  On the rare occasions where problems do occur, troubleshooting time is minimized as there are no 3rd party vendors to deal with in investigating the problem.  Enterprise Server & Software Solution In order to provide one stop shop convenience to its customers, AccessTEL provides services and supports the customer office communication network as follows: •	Internet Gateway Server •	Mail Server •	Web Server •	Webmail Server •	Content Filtering Server •	DNS Server •	Proxy/Cache Server •	Bandwidth Management Server •	File Server •	Database Server •	Firewall Server •	Mail Server SPAM Guard  •	Mail Server and work station Virus Protection  Value Added Services (VAS) AccessTEL Value Added Services (VAS) has been designed keeping the Enterprise communications requirements in mind as follows:  Mail/Webmail: - POP3, IMAP and Webmail access services.  Mail Backup:- Email backup service acts as the second priority mail server for the client mail server. In case the client mail server cannot be reached, the mail will be routed to our mail backup server and wait in queues. Our server will keep checking the client mail server every 30 minutes. Once the client mail server is detected available, our mail server will forward the emails to the client mail server. Our mail server will keep attempting to deliver mail to the client mail server for 5 days. Mails queued in our mail server exceeding 5 days will be returned to the sender. It is important to note that although the client does not lose any mail due to this backup service, the sender is sent bounced mail message during the time the client server is unreachable.    Managed & Support Services  AccessTEL provides the following customer services: •	IT Consulting, customer network design & development •	Customer Server Management and Maintenance •	Routine onsite LAN Management & Maintenance •	Managed VPN Services •	IP VPN •	MPLS VPN •	Co-Location Service of Client Server in AccessTELNOC •	On call site support Dark Fiber AccessTEL Dark Fiber is an optimum solution for very high-speed data applications and gives you access to on-going network growth while maintaining full control of your fiber-optic network.                                          Clear Channel          L3 Connectivity   Based on a probabilistic analysis of achievable capacity on individual links of a random topology, we introduce a novel connectivity metric for wireless ad-hoc networks.         Network Elements: The AccessTEL network element consists of 3 parts as follows:  ?	Network Core o	Carrier grade MPLS Upstream, Downstream & Aggregation routers o	Carrier grade manageable Aggregation Ethernet switches o	Upstream management & Traffic Shaping o	Server Farm ?	Network Backbone o	Fiber Optics o	High Capacity Radio o	STM Connectivity between cities in Bangladesh over the mobile/NTTN operator TDM Network  ?	Network Distribution o	Wi-Max 802.16e wireless network on 3.5 GHz exclusive band o	Pre-Wi-Max wireless network on 3.5 GHz exclusive band o	Point to Multi-Point Radio Network on ISM band o	Fiber Optic Network Distribution o	Network Management System o	OLT   Network Core: The core network of AccessTEL consists of 4 distinctive parts; routing, switching, traffic shaping & core IP services application management. AccessTel core is designed for high speed, reliability and scalable advanced IP network. The network core is currently MPLS backbone. It currently supports IPv4, IPv6, scalable multicast and other networking protocols. The IP/MPLS core is the backbone that interconnects all Ethernet aggregation networks and the Service/Application layer.  The core is connected to redundant aggregation level TSR metro Ethernet switches. These are in turn connected to a resilient fiber ring that supports carrier-class automatic failure protection. MPLS-based Traffic Engineering, VPN capabilities and QOS allow this network to provide a whole suite of networking solutions to customers.  The Service layer hosts the core applications, essential to functioning and management of the network. This is where AAA policies are enforced and billing data is collected. The Application layer hosts applications that are value additions, for example, Mail, IP Telephony etc.  ?  Core Network Diagram:    ?  Server Farm:     Network Backbone: We have built an extensive backbone for interconnecting our nationwide and city POPs to our NOC in Dhaka. All AccessTEL POP have redundant connectivity for ensuring high level uptime.  All nationwide intercity connectivity is established separate mobile operator network for primary and secondary routes. All backbone within the same city is fully owned and managed by AccessTEL consisting of fiber optic, free space optics and high capacity radio technologies. The core backbone network has a carrier of carrier architecture which enables the provisioning of multiple types of last mile technology used for Broadband connectivity from any of the Alap POPs.    ?  Network Distribution:  BWA Network Distribution The present Pre-WiMax last mile network is typically used to connect customers with bandwidth requirement between 64 kbps to 768 kbps while the WiMax 802.16e network is able to connect customers with bandwidth requirements up to 5 Mbps.  All the distribution sites (POP) are strategically deployed for optimum coverage for the 3.5 GHz licensed frequency BWA network for easy, quick and cost effective BWA services.  The Pre-WiMax and WiMax BWA are True non-line-of-sight Wireless Data Network infrastructures for BWA Connectivity with Dedicated & Shared Bandwidth Allocations for corporate and residential customers. AccessTEL began building and providing services through the BWA Network during 2004. The Wireless Network Architecture is an NLOS BWA architecture with scalability, reliability and flexibility for meeting customer requirements.  We expect to increase wireless coverage by employing LTE networks in the future and intend to redeploy the Pre-WiMax and WiMax networks to smaller cities across the country.   Point to Point Radio Network Distribution Typically used to connect customers outside the BWA Network coverage areas and for customers with bandwidth requirement higher than the bandwidth that is available on the BWA networks.  All the distribution sites (POP) are strategically deployed for optimum coverage for ISM bnad point to point and point to multipoint radio network for customer connectivity for easy, quick and cost effective Broadband services.    Fiber Optics Distribution Network  The FON distribution network is used for Fiber Optic connectivity for our high bandwidth users.  Data rates range between from 1 Mbps to 1000 Mbps for customers.  When our fibre customers need bandwidth upgrades there is no need to send any engineer to customer sites or our POP as the data rate assigned to the customer on the FON distribution network can be changed remotely from our FON management system.  Network Management System (NMS)   Key to the Central Network Management System is the ability for the network management functionality to be as robust as the network itself, addressing any unit on the network, 24 hours a day, and seven days a week in a reliable, cost-effective manner. AccessTEL’s network operations center can view the entire network in real-time without the need for supplementary connections or equipment. The NMS including our subscriber management system for the provisioning of Broadband Access allows real time and cost effective management of the network operations. AccessTEL competitive advantage is greatly accelerated due to the time it takes to bring high-speed access to the customers and modify any service level agreements centrally as per customer requests.   Quality of Service Assurance: Network uptime and quality of service is of primary concern to AccessTEL and a key differentiator with our competitors.  Network uptime is also the most vital component of achieving the committed quality of services.  It is for this reason the Alap 24 x 365 Network Operations Center (NOC) is staffed with skilled personnel to monitor, manage and troubleshoot network issues to maintain the expected and committed Quality of Services (QOS). Network Management Methodology: ?	SNMP system has been implemented to monitor in real time all network device activities and generate alarms when performance goes below established benchmarks ?	During office hours all respective departments responsible for managing the various network segments monitor the SNMP system and immediately troubleshoots any network alarms for which they are responsible for  ?	After office hours the SNMP system is monitored by the 24x7 Phone Support team and upon generation of any alarms immediately determines department responsible for troubleshooting the detected problem and informs the designated department personnel for further action related to the problem  Management of the 3 Network Elements: We have developed 2 types of teams to manage our network elements.  While a central Core team manages the Network Core element, 4 separate Access teams manage the Network Backbone and Network Distribution elements.  Access teams in their respective regions are responsible for managing both the Network Backbone and Network Distribution elements in their respective regions.  Network Coverage: The AccessTEL nationwide network is based on a highly scalable and modular design.  ccessTEL policy is to upgrade capacity upon reaching 70% utilization of available capacity. The ability to quickly and cost effectively upgrade network capacity as and when required ensures not only customer satisfaction but also efficient utilization of company capital resources.   We have built an extensive backbone for interconnecting our nationwide and city POPs to our NOC in Dhaka. All Alap POP have redundant connectivity for ensuring high level uptime.  All nationwide intercity connectivity is established by separate mobile operator and NTTN network for primary and secondary routes.    Divisional Coverage   ? District Coverage     ?

The USTDA feasibility study was a key factor and starting point for the present nationwide network design, vendor selection and network deployment. Equipment and vendors used in the various Alap network segments are as follows: ?

In areas where there was some telecommunications infrastructure we were unable to piggyback on due to the unwillingness of the state run telecom operator to share their infrastructure. It is for this very reason the Bangladesh market is quite unique since Internet and Data service providers had to literally build the end to end infrastructure to provide services to their respective clients.  AccessTEL has always been quick to adapt to new and more efficient technologies in order to continue being able to address its customers growing demands and needs.  It is for this reason the structure of the company has been designed to address both the technology and customer support requirements.  The structural design of the company also aims at maintaining its position in the market to continue being ahead of its competition in terms having technology and infrastructural advantages.  Although technology plays a big factor in Alap having advantages over its competitors, the key factor has always been its personnel.  Dedication In an industry where employee turnover is usually high, the Alap experience in this regard has been very positive.  Since its inception the employee turnover has been exceptionally low in the upper and mid management levels.    Perhaps a primary reason for this long term dedication is due to the working conditions of the company and the confidence in the sponsor directors leadership and visions about the future growth prospects of the company.   Although the sponsor directors actively participate in the company operations, there is no micro management and department heads are given the full freedom and empowered to carry on their duties as per company established policies.    Education & Training As a policy of the company all positions starting from Executive level and up must at least have a Bachelors degree from an accredited University.  It is important to note that there is a significant amount of training given to all relevant employees of the company from both internal and external resources.   A big reason for this is that the training needed for the state-of-the-art technology and network is not available in the regular accredited Universities of Bangladesh.  For example, only recently everyone is talking about WiMax technology and Broadband Wireless Access.  However, ccessTEL has been training its staff to build, operate and manage WiMax BWA networks since   The year 2004. Then between 2006 and 2007 ccessTEL began training its employees on building, operating and managing an all IP Carrier Ethernet Fiber Optics Network based on Packet Switching technology. Whereas the traditionally Fiber Optic Networks are based on circuit switching technology.    Although a significant amount of training is concentrated in the technology training areas, AccessTEL periodically trains its staff on non-technology related training i.e. Team Building, Phone Support Manner, Habits of Effective Communications, and Effective Sales Techniques.  Ongoing and advance training on new items as well as refreshers are a must for AccessTEL to maintain its edge over all its competitors today and in the future.

Backspace empowers its stakeholders to advance in the constantly evolving landscape of information and communication.  Soon after, the company diverted its resources and focus to Affiliate Marketing through our website, recognizing the opportunity and merit in this method of marketing. The company ran a website that provided detailed information on products and services.  Observing the success of the website with Affiliate Marketing and getting a taste of Digital Marketing, backspace wanted to expand its boundaries. That came with the inception of the YouTube channel which delivered quality video content on product reviews. The success of our channel allowed us to hold a strong position and get more partners for affiliation. In this period, backspace expanded its focus to video content, rather than just textual content only.  Both the website and YouTube channel were big successes and Backspace started its own video production agency. That opened up the door for another big opportunity as we started collaborating with international e-commerce marketplaces like Banggood, GearBest and partnering up with global brands like LG, and Whirlpool. BlitzWolf and Insta360. It also heavily partnered up with Amazon sellers in various aspects of digital and affiliate marketing and collaborated with several crowd-funded projects in various capacities.  In 2019, the company started making content on shopping guides and animated documentaries for different platforms. Then in 2020, the company gradually started producing more digital content for its partners and became the partner of Amazon creator hub to make shopping guides in the form of videos for Amazon’s visitors. Now the company is aiming to provide its partners with superior content marketing, and affiliate marketing with relevant product videos, and animated content. Review Zone, one of Backspace’s largest ventures, was born at that moment because the market demand was rising like never before. In this period, the resources employed by Backspace have tripled than it was at the beginning. In addition to that, Backspace also needed to expand its physical location to accommodate the increasing resources.  As the new decade started, Backspace came up with multiple ventures to work on within the upcoming days. The new ventures include Research-Based Online Media, Content Production & Marketing, Digital marketing, and E-Commerce. Backspace expanded its physical location once again to cope with its incremental activities. The Review Zone sums up about 14 brands so far and more are forthcoming.","5th Floor, Amir Tower, Dholairpar, Jatrabari, Dhaka 1204",Jatrabari,1204,01945347502,mailnow@werbackspace.com,http://www.werbackspace.com,Limited Company,,Media Kit Production

We work with leadership to work together as a team, instead of in silos across their areas of responsibility. We enable empowerment of your teams who are closest to your customers and the problems to deliver impactful solutions whether they are products or services. This can be done when the leadership team clearly articulates the vision and strategy and listens to those on the ground solving the customers problems.  TMAS – Crafting Agility, starts by helping you take a look at what your company values from a planning perspective and comparing that against what your customer values from a delivery perspective. Organizations often find themselves operating in ways that don’t align with the goals of their customers. They might try to adopt agile to get things in sync, but end up out of alignment with how the rest of their company does business. Getting everyone working together is a process that can be planned and executed with clearly defined goals and measurable outcomes.  Making the journey involves defining a team based organizational structure, a governance model to coordinate value, and a metrics strategy to guide and shape your transformation activities. TMAS – Crafting Agility, helps you craft a pilot approach to exercise the structure, validate the framework, and challenge any assumptions made during planning.

With a rich portfolio of over 10,000 campaigns across diverse devices, applications, and platforms, BrillMark® is committed to delivering innovative solutions in the realm of Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO).   Goals  At BrillMark®, our dual mission is to provide reliable and affordable testing for CRO agencies and in-house campaigns.

As part of our commitment to nurturing talent globally, we continuously train and employ skilled developers from around the world.    Why Choose BrillMark Discovery We like to start our process with an audit to evaluate improvement plans against the control plan. Usually, your in-house team or a CRO agency will perform the audit itself. Performing audits is not in our usual scope of work but our team members have the necessary knowledge so if neither of the options mentioned above is available we can assist with the audit as well. Once the criteria for testing are set in place our development team will take over and start building the tests.  Technical Design Our ab test development job begins when you decide on the website experiment’s needs and parameters. Our specialists will create a technical specification for the test, estimate the needed hours, and send over a quote for your approval.  Development & QA Once the technical specification is confirmed, our team will construct the test locally, migrate it to your preferred testing platform, and apply the platform-specific parameters. The created test is then given to our quality assurance department for a thorough examination and finally to you for final approval. Deployment Once you’ve accepted the produced test, it’s ready to go live. We will actively monitor the tests for the first 24–48 hours to verify they run as planned and that all goals and metrics are monitored and tracked accurately.

Finally, the breakthrough came with a corporate client in December 2009 and there has been no turning back ever since. They setup a sales and marketing office in Munich, Germany and New Delhi, India in 2011 and will soon be setting up an office in Montreal, Canada.  European IT also provides website domain registration and offers very competitive hosting packages.  European IT tries to use simple, yet elegant design for websites. Keeping the limitations of mobile phones for web browsing in mind, they try not to use heavy embedding or develop Flash based websites unless specifically requested by a client. Their applications are developed mainly using PHP, Javascript, MySQL or other open source languages. For the products, Oracle database can be used depending on the client’s licensing capacity.

We have software for vessel caliber and width measurement, retinal image calibration, retinal central light reflex quantification, focal arteriolar narrowing, and artery-vein nicking quantification, which are significant features for early detection of Diabetes, hypertension, and Cardiovascular Heart Disease (CVD) and Stroke. We aim to develop a system for early screening of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Based on this work, we also aim to develop a prediction model for screening individuals at risk of systemic diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and CVD. A retinal imaging-based system will screen these diseases from regular visits to Family Physician, Community Clinics, Optometrist, or Ophthalmologist. An integrated screening system will help prevent these diseases, improve the patient’s quality of life, and save billions of dollars in healthcare costs. Today, the telemedicine field is changing faster than ever before. Therefore, another aim is to develop a telemedicine platform. Telemedicine was initially intended to treat patients who were located in remote places, far away from health facilities, or in areas of shortages of medical professionals. Telemedicine is still used today to address these problems. It’s increasingly become a tool for convenient medical care. Today’s connected patient wants to waste less time in the waiting room, and get immediate care when they decide they want or need the care.

Using iCR, developers don't need to waste time triaging the faulty bug reports.   2. iCR is Super Sensitive: iCR finds critical bugs that currently available tools miss and thus gives you confidence in your code.   3. iCR is Super Helpful as it can FIX the bugs automatically: iCR is the only software/tool in the world that can automatically fix the bugs in the codebase without humans doing the correction manually in the code. All you have to do is click a few times to get your bugs fixed in the sourcecode.

As an IGW (International Gateway) license holder, Platinum Communications Ltd offers wholesale voice business globally and (Caller Line Identification) CLI termination into Bangladesh. Platinum has partnership with globally renowned telecom operators to put a bigger footprint in the global voice communication by carrying A to Z traffic.   Background History During its inception, like other IGW operators of Bangladesh, it used to follow the then (International Long Distance Telecommunication Services (ILDTS) policy where it was connected to all Interconnection Exchanges (ICXs) towards downstream and through them to all ANSs i.e. to all mobile and PSTN operators of Bangladesh.  On the other hand, it was directly connected to many international tier-1 carriers towards upstream such as TATA, Bharti, Telecom Malaysia, Vodafone, Singtel etc.  International carriers used to terminate international incoming voice traffic through Platinum Communication and side by side Platinum Communication used to pass international outgoing traffic originated from Bangladeshi mobile and PSTN operators through them. During this regime, bulk of revenue used come from foreign companies for international incoming voice traffic and from ANSs operators for international outgoing traffic. In 2015, ILDTS policy was changed by a directives from BTRC whereas all active IGWs were grouped into two tiers and created a forum consisting of all IGW operators called IGW Operators Forum (IOF) to administer them. Seven (07) IGWs composing Tier-2 IGWs were made responsible to be only connected with all ICXs than to ANS operator’s thereby made those only authorities to be able to terminate all international incoming traffic inside Bangladesh.  Whereas other fifteen (15) IGWs forming tier-1 IGWs were compelled to terminate international incoming traffic through tier-2 IGWs. This proved to be a successful model by which traffic flow to and from Bangladesh were effectively and efficiently controlled and stabilized. Besides changing the network topology it had also modified the financial model where all IGWs were compelled to pay 60% of respective revenue share to IOF Operators Switches (IOSs) and 35% share of revenue directly to BTRC and rest 5% revenue to VoIP Service Providers (VSPs). This 60% of revenue share includes share of ANSs, ICXs and IGW’s own profit. IOF ensures payment of respective ANSs and ICXs from that fund and accumulate all IGW’s share into Revenue Sharing Pool (RSP). At the end of months, these RSPs are distributed to all IGWs at a ratio of 1.9: 1 respectively tier-2: tier-1. These created a second cash flow for all IGWs beside revenue from direct sales to upstream.  How IGW Works As per ILDTS policy and IGW licensing guideline, any international voice call either terminated or originated to/from to Bangladeshi mobile or PSTN operators must pass through IGW switches. The product that an IGW sells to upstream foreign carriers is ‘Call Minutes’ or ‘Routes’. IGWs can have any amount of ‘Call Minutes’ or ‘Routes’ basing on their Bank Guarantee (BG) placed to IOSs. IOSs will allow to terminate any amount of international incoming voice traffic so long BG amount is not exhausted. BG amount is calculated @USD 0.02/call minutes.
